# Lab 4 — Cloud Service Models Evaluation

## Aim
To analyze IaaS, PaaS, SaaS using real provider services.

## Learning Outcomes
- Distinguish service models
- Map services correctly
- Understand responsibility split

## Tools
AWS/Azure/GCP websites (no paid signup required)

## Procedure

Step 1 — Identify 3 services each:

IaaS examples — VM, block storage, VPC  
PaaS examples — App Engine, Azure App Service  
SaaS examples — Gmail, Salesforce

Step 2 — Create responsibility matrix:
Who manages:
- OS
- Runtime
- Network
- Application
- Data

Step 3 — Create stack diagram for each model.

Step 4 — Write pros/cons:
Give 3 each per model.

## Output
- Service list table
- Responsibility matrix
- 3 stack diagrams

## Submission
Upload to GitHub.


# Lab 5 — Cloud Provider Service Mapping

## Aim
To compare services across major cloud providers.

## Learning Outcomes
- Map equivalent services
- Understand provider differences
- Select provider by need

## Tools
Provider documentation sites

## Procedure

Step 1 — Compare providers:
AWS | Azure | Google Cloud

Step 2 — Map equivalent services:

Compute  
Storage  
Managed Database  
Serverless  
Load Balancer  

Step 3 — Create mapping table.

Step 4 — Mini case study:
Small startup web app — choose provider + service stack + reason.

Step 5 — Rough monthly cost estimate using provider calculator.

## Output
- Mapping table
- Case study selection
- Cost estimate sheet

## Submission
GitHub upload.
